A data directory will be created on the main folder, and the data will be dowloaded into the directory. Moreover, the data will be available only locale due the size. The data contains 924.621 entrys for the test and 458.913 for training. Maybe can have miss values on the columns and possible the data needs some processing. A further analysis will be conducted on the next stage before implementation of the model."
